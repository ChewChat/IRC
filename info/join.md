# Join The Network

You can join the network via KiwiIRC or IRCCloud (web clients) or your own choice of desktop/mobile client. We recommend IRCCloud as your client because of its mobile apps and always connected feature.

We recommend joining with `irc.chew.chat`, to join a random server. Below are direct IPs to each server.
