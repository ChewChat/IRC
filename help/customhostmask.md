## Introduction

Requirement:
[You MUST be identified with NickServ](http://chewcraft.github.io/IRC/help/registernickserv#Authenticating-on-Login)!

Let’s get a hostmask.

You can either use a hostmask provided by the server, or request your own custom one.

### Server Hostmask

It’s simple! Type `/hs offerlist`.

You now have a list of available offers. The bot will guide you on how to take a vhost, and to enable it type `/hs on`

You’re done!

### Custom Hostmask

To request a hostmask, you must do something similar.

Type `/hs request [your hostmask]`

Rules for hostmasks:
No spaces or other special characters (emojis for example), dots are allowed.

## Extra Info

We will process your request in a reasonable amount of time, bugging us will lower your priority.

Thanks and have a great day
